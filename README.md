# DuelShot
I've always wanted to make a game. Recently, I have been working with iOS, and while I was on a plane suffering from appendicitis, I came up with the idea to make this game.
The purpose of the game is to play with friends in the same vacinity as you. The screen is split in half, with one side dedicated to each player. Players can move freely on their sides and shoot projectiles at each other through the barrier that goes down the middle. It uses Apple's MultipeerConnectivity to connect players over Bluetooth and LANs, and uses SpriteKit for all of the graphics and animations.
